## Recent Fixes

- ‚úÖ **Marker placement during rotation**: FIXED - Markers now appear exactly where clicked, even when disk is rotating. The problem was coordinate space confusion between click coordinates and rendered coordinates. Fixed by:
  1. Removing `+ DiskRotation` from `CalculateMarkerPosition` (graphics transform handles rotation)
  2. Implementing proper inverse transform in `CalculateAngleAccountingForRotation` to convert click position back to unrotated coordinate space
  3. Verified working for all scenarios: stationary disk, spinning disk, and stopped-after-rotation disk

- ‚úÖ **Right-click functionality**: RESTORED - Right-click drag on markers to adjust velocity (vertical) and note length (horizontal)

- ‚úÖ **Double-click to remove**: ADDED - Double-click any marker to remove it (500ms threshold)

- ‚úÖ **Right-click text rotation**: FIXED - Velocity and note length text indicators no longer rotate with the disk. Moved drawing outside the rotation transform so text stays upright. Confirmed working!

- ‚úÖ **Remove "12" text**: FIXED - Found and removed the "12" text from `DrawPlayheadLabel` method in CircularCanvas. Removed both the method call and the entire method.

- ‚úÖ **Play/Stop button consolidation**: IMPROVED - Replaced separate Play and Stop buttons with a single toggle button that shows "üéµ Play" (green) when stopped and "‚èπ Stop" (red) when playing. Also updated the menu to use the same toggle command.
