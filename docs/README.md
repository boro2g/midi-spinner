## Key Concepts

### The Circular Interface
The heart of Circular MIDI Generator is its innovative circular interface. Unlike traditional linear sequencers, this tool uses a spinning disk where:

- **Markers** represent MIDI notes placed around the circle
- **Colors** determine pitch using an intuitive chromatic mapping
- **Position** on the circle determines timing
- **The Playhead** at 12 o'clock triggers notes as markers pass by

### Lanes and Channels
The application supports multiple lanes, each with:
- Independent MIDI channel routing
- Individual quantization settings
- Visual color coding for organization
- Easy lane selection from the right panel

### Real-Time Performance
Designed for live performance and studio work:
- Low-latency MIDI output (< 5ms typical)
- Smooth 60fps animations
- Responsive touch and gesture controls
- Reliable synchronization with external DAWs

## System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows 10, macOS 10.15, or Ubuntu 20.04
- **Processor**: Dual-core 2.0 GHz
- **Memory**: 4 GB RAM
- **Storage**: 100 MB available space
- **Graphics**: DirectX 11 or OpenGL 3.3 compatible

### Recommended Requirements
- **Processor**: Quad-core 3.0 GHz or faster
- **Memory**: 8 GB RAM or more
- **Audio Interface**: ASIO-compatible for lowest latency
- **MIDI Controller**: Hardware controller for enhanced workflow
