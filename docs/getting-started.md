## General Setup (All Platforms)

### 1. MIDI Setup

Before creating music, you need to set up MIDI output:

1. **Connect Your MIDI Device**
   - Hardware synthesizer via USB or MIDI interface
   - Software synthesizer or DAW running on your computer
   - Virtual MIDI cable (loopMIDI on Windows, IAC Driver on macOS)

2. **Select MIDI Output**
   - In Circular MIDI Generator, find the **"MIDI Out:"** dropdown in the control panel
   - Select your desired output device (e.g., "IAC Bus 1" for Ableton Live on macOS)
   - Click the **üîÑ** refresh button if your device doesn't appear
   - The dropdown will show "No device selected" until you choose one

3. **Test MIDI Output**
   - Click anywhere on the circular disk to place a marker
   - Press the Play button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è)
   - You should hear a note when the marker passes the top (12 o'clock)

### 2. Creating Your First Pattern

Let's create a simple drum pattern:

1. **Place Kick Drum Markers**
   - Click at the 12 o'clock position (top) for beat 1
   - Click at the 6 o'clock position (bottom) for beat 3
   - These red markers will trigger low notes (kick drum sounds)

2. **Add Snare Hits**
   - Click at 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions
   - These should appear as different colored markers
   - They'll trigger higher pitched notes (snare sounds)

3. **Start Playback**
   - Press the Play button
   - Watch the playhead rotate and trigger your markers
   - Adjust BPM using the tempo control (try 120 BPM)

4. **Adjust Velocities**
   - Drag markers up and down to change their velocity (volume)
   - Higher positions = louder notes
   - Lower positions = quieter notes

### 3. Understanding the Interface

#### Main Elements
- **Circular Disk**: The main workspace where you place markers
- **Playhead**: Red line at 12 o'clock that triggers notes
- **Markers**: Colored dots that represent MIDI notes
- **Control Panel**: Two-row layout with playback and file controls
  - **Top Row**: Play button, BPM control, MIDI device selection, Quantize checkbox
  - **Bottom Row**: Save, Load, Reset, and Stop All Notes buttons
- **Lane Panel**: Right sidebar for managing different instrument tracks

#### Color Coding
Markers are automatically colored based on their pitch:
- **Red**: C (low notes, good for kick drums)
- **Orange**: C# / Db
- **Yellow**: D
- **Green**: D# / Eb
- **Blue**: E
- **Purple**: F
- And so on through the chromatic scale...

#### Timing
- **Position on circle**: Determines when the note plays
- **12 o'clock**: Beat 1 (downbeat)
- **3 o'clock**: Beat 2
- **6 o'clock**: Beat 3
- **9 o'clock**: Beat 4

### 4. Using Quantization

Quantization helps you place markers precisely on musical beats:

1. **Enable Quantization**
   - Click the "Grid" button to enable quantization
   - You'll see grid lines appear on the disk

2. **Choose Grid Division**
   - Select from 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, or 1/32 notes
   - Finer divisions allow more precise timing

3. **Snap to Grid**
   - When quantization is on, markers automatically snap to grid lines
   - This ensures perfect timing alignment

### 5. Working with Multiple Lanes

Lanes let you create complex arrangements with different instruments:

1. **Select a Lane**
   - Click on Lane 1, 2, 3, or 4 buttons in the right panel
   - Each lane has its own color and MIDI channel

2. **Assign Markers to Lanes**
   - Select a lane before placing markers
   - New markers will be assigned to the currently selected lane
   - Each lane can have independent quantization settings

3. **Lane Organization**
   - Use different lanes for different instruments (drums, bass, melody, etc.)
   - Each lane sends to a different MIDI channel
   - Visual color coding helps organize complex arrangements

## Common First-Time Issues

### No Sound
- **Check MIDI device selection**: Ensure correct output device is selected in the "MIDI Out:" dropdown
- **Verify connections**: Make sure your synthesizer/DAW is receiving MIDI
- **Test with simple software**: Try a basic software synth first
- **macOS**: Ensure IAC Driver is enabled and Ableton track is armed

### macOS-Specific Issues
- **"App can't be opened"**: Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy, click "Open Anyway"
- **IAC Bus not visible**: Open Audio MIDI Setup, enable IAC Driver, restart both applications
- **No sound in Ableton**: Check that the MIDI track is armed and has an instrument loaded
- **Permission issues**: Grant audio/microphone permissions when prompted

### Timing Issues
- **Enable quantization**: Use grid snap for precise timing
- **Check BPM**: Ensure tempo matches your expectations (try 120 BPM first)
- **Ableton sync**: If using Ableton Live, enable sync mode for tempo matching

### Performance Issues
- **Close other applications**: Free up system resources
- **Adjust buffer settings**: In your audio interface control panel
- **Update drivers**: Ensure MIDI and audio drivers are current
- **macOS**: Close unnecessary background apps, check Activity Monitor for CPU usage

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basics:

1. **Explore Advanced Features**
   - **Multi-selection**: Hold Ctrl/Cmd and click to select multiple markers
   - **Drag to remove**: Drag markers outside the disk edge to delete them
   - **Velocity control**: Drag markers up/down to adjust volume
   - **Lane switching**: Try different lanes for different instruments

2. **Save and Organize Your Work**
   - Use the **üíæ Save** button to preserve your patterns as JSON files
   - Use the **üìÅ Load** button to restore saved projects
   - Use the **üóëÔ∏è Reset** button to clear all markers and start fresh
   - Auto-save protects against crashes and unexpected shutdowns

3. **Advanced DAW Integration**
   - **Ableton Live**: Follow the [setup guide](#macos--ableton-live-quick-setup) above
   - **Other DAWs**: Use virtual MIDI cables (IAC on macOS, loopMIDI on Windows)
   - **Recording**: Capture MIDI output in your DAW for further editing
   - **Multiple tracks**: Use different lanes to control different instruments

4. **Creative Techniques**
   - **Polyrhythms**: Use different quantization settings on different lanes
   - **Velocity patterns**: Create dynamic patterns by varying marker heights
   - **Tempo changes**: Experiment with different BPM settings for different feels
   - **Live performance**: Use the interface for real-time pattern creation
